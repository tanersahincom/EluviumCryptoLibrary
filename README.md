# Services

**AeAes256CbcHmacSha512:** File encryption service for your files. It uses 256 bit CBC encryption with Sha512 and password verification for your files.

File Encryption Example:


```
     private readonly AeAes256CbcHmacSha512 _aesEncryptionService = new AeAes256CbcHmacSha512();

     _aesEncryptionService.EncryptFile(file, directoryPath + "/" + fileName + ".enc", _yourPassword, true);

     _aesEncryptionService.OnEncryptionProgress += _aesEncryptionService_OnEncryptionProgress;
     
     private void _aesEncryptionService_OnEncryptionProgress(int percentageDone, string message)
     {
            if (percentageDone == 100)
            {
              CompletedTextBlock.Text = "Completed";
            }
     }
```

File Decryption Example:

```
   private readonly AeAes256CbcHmacSha512 _aesEncryptionService = new AeAes256CbcHmacSha512();
   
   var result = _aesEncryptionService.DecryptFile(file, directoryPath + "/" + fileName, yourPassword , true);
   
   _aesEncryptionService.OnDecryptionProgress += _aesEncryptionService_OnDecryptionProgress;
   
   private void _aesEncryptionService_OnDecryptionProgress(int percentageDone, string message)
   {
          if (percentageDone == 100)
            {
              CompletedTextBlock.Text = "Completed";
            }
   }
```


**AesStringEncryptionService:** Encrypt string data using AesStringEncryptionService. It uses 256 bit AES CBC encryption to protect data. There are two methods for perform
encrypt and decrypt string data

```
EncryptString(string plainText, string passPhrase) // Encrypt string value

DecryptString(string encrypted, string passPhrase) // Decrypt string value
```


**DigitalSignatureService:**  They are used to send information to recipients who can verify that the information was sent from a trusted sender, using a public key.

```
CreatePublicAndPrivateKeyPair() // Returns two RSAParameters that contains private and public keys and also only returns public key

Sign(string message, RSAParameters privateAndPublicKeys) // Sign your message using private and public keys

Verify(string message, byte[] signature, RSAParameters publicKeyOnly) // Verify your message using public key only
```

**HashingService:** It allows you to hash your string data securely. Whereas encryption is a two-way function, hashing is a one-way function.
While itâ€™s technically possible to reverse-hash something, the computing power required makes it unfeasible. Hashing is one-way.

```
string MultipleHash(string value) // Using them combined
string Sha256(string input)
string Sha384(string input)
string Sha512(string input)
```

**PasswordAdvisorService:** Password advisor service checks the Pwned Passwords API to see if the password has been seen in any data breaches. It's using k-anonymity
algorithm to securely search. Also checks your password's security level.

```
async Task<(bool passwordCompromised, int breachCount)> CheckPasswordAsync(string password) // breachCount value returns how 
// many times that password seen in that database and passwordCompromised returns true if that password has been compromised

PasswordScoreEnum CheckStrength(string password) // Checks your password's security level. 
//Return tipe is Enum that calculates security score of password from 0 to 5
```

**PasswordGeneratorService:** Generate secure passwords using PasswordGeneratorService service.

```
 string GeneratePassword(int length, bool lowercase, bool uppercase, bool number, bool character, bool special)
```
